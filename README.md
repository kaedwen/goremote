This small project should enable you to perform tasks remotely on a machine.

### Config

Most properties can be specified as arguments and environment variables. Setting the argument `--config-file` or the environment variable `CONFIG_FILE` will also read the configuration from there with highest priority.

Task definitions can be specified in the config gile only.
Have a look to the example [config.yaml](./example/config.yaml)

### Build
Just run make
```
make
```
